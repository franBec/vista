# Project Preferences

- Package manager: pnpm is preferred over npm
- Commits:
  - Don't commit unless explicitly asked for it
  - Include a summary of changes in commit messages for better documentation
- Formatting: Run the format script (`pnpm format`) before any commit to ensure
  consistent code style
- Comments: Avoid adding code comments unless absolutely necessary for clarity
- Components: Prefer using shadcn components when possible for consistent UI
- Verification: Avoid starting a development server to verify changes. Usually
  there's going to be a development server already running at port 3000
